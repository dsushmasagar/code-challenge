            "title": "Trustworthy Chrome Extensions, by default",
            "description": "li {   line-height: 1.38 !important; }  Incredibly, it’s been nearly a decade since we launched the Chrome extensions system. Thanks to the hard work and innovation of our developer community, there are now more than 180,000 extensions in the Chrome Web Store, and nearly half of Chrome desktop users actively use extensions to customize Chrome and their experience on the web.The extensions team's dual mission is to help users tailor Chrome’s functionality to their individual needs and interests, and to empower developers to build rich and useful extensions. But, first and foremost, it’s crucial that users be able to trust the extensions they install are safe, privacy-preserving, and performant. Users should always have full transparency about the scope of their extensions’ capabilities and data access.We’ve recently taken a number of steps toward improved extension security with the launch of out-of-process iframes, the removal of inline installation, and significant advancements in our ability to detect and block malicious extensions using machine learning. Looking ahead, there are more fundamental changes needed so that all Chrome extensions are trustworthy by default.Today we’re announcing some upcoming changes and plans for the future:User controls for host permissionsBeginning in Chrome 70, users will have the choice to restrict extension host access to a custom list of sites, or to configure extensions to require a click to gain access to the current page.While host permissions have enabled thousands of powerful and creative extension use cases, they have also led to a broad range of misuse - both malicious and unintentional - because they allow extensions to automatically read and change data on websites. Our aim is to improve user transparency and control over when extensions are able to access site data. In subsequent milestones, we’ll continue to optimize the user experience toward this goal while improving usability. If your extension requests host permissions, we encourage you to review our transition guide and begin testing as soon as possible.Changes to the extensions review processGoing forward, extensions that request powerful permissions will be subject to additional compliance review. We’re also looking very closely at extensions that use remotely hosted code, with ongoing monitoring. Your extension’s permissions should be as narrowly-scoped as possible, and all your code should be included directly in the extension package, to minimize review time.New code readability requirementsStarting today, Chrome Web Store will no longer allow extensions with obfuscated code. This includes code within the extension package as well as any external code or resource fetched from the web. This policy applies immediately to all new extension submissions. Existing extensions with obfuscated code can continue to submit updates over the next 90 days, but will be removed from the Chrome Web Store in early January if not compliant.Today over 70% of malicious and policy violating extensions that we block from Chrome Web Store contain obfuscated code. At the same time, because obfuscation is mainly used to conceal code functionality, it adds a great deal of complexity to our review process. This is no longer acceptable given the aforementioned review process changes. Additionally, since JavaScript code is always running locally on the user's machine, obfuscation is insufficient to protect proprietary code from a truly motivated reverse engineer. Obfuscation techniques also come with hefty performance costs such as slower execution and increased file and memory footprints.Ordinary minification, on the other hand, typically speeds up code execution as it reduces code size, and is much more straightforward to review. Thus, minification will still be allowed, including the following techniques:Removal of whitespace, newlines, code comments, and block delimitersShortening of variable and function namesCollapsing the number of JavaScript filesIf you have an extension in the store with obfuscated code, please review our updated content policies as well as our recommended minification techniques for Google Developers, and submit a new compliant version before January 1st, 2019.Required 2-Step VerificationIn 2019, enrollment in 2-Step Verification will be required for Chrome Web Store developer accounts. If your extension becomes popular, it can attract attackers who want to steal it by hijacking your account, and 2-Step Verification adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second authentication step from your phone or a physical security key. We strongly recommend that you enroll as soon as possible.For even stronger account security, consider the Advanced Protection Program. Advanced protection offers the same level of security that Google relies on for its own employees, requiring a physical security key to provide the strongest defense against phishing attacks.Looking ahead: Manifest v3In 2019 we will introduce the next extensions manifest version. Manifest v3 will entail additional platform changes that aim to create stronger security, privacy, and performance guarantees. We want to help all developers fall into the pit of success; writing a secure and performant extension in Manifest v3 should be easy, while writing an insecure or non-performant extension should be difficult. Some key goals of manifest v3 include:More narrowly-scoped and declarative APIs, to decrease the need for overly-broad access and enable more performant implementation by the browser, while preserving important functionalityAdditional, easier mechanisms for users to control the permissions granted to extensionsModernizing to align with new web capabilities, such as supporting Service Workers as a new type of background processWe intend to make the transition to manifest v3 as smooth as possible and we’re thinking carefully about the rollout plan. We’ll be in touch soon with more specific details. We recognize that some of the changes announced today may require effort in the future, depending on your extension. But we believe the collective result will be worth that effort for all users, developers, and for the long term health of the Chrome extensions ecosystem. We’re committed to working with you to transition through these changes and are very interested in your feedback. If you have questions or comments, please get in touch with us on the Chromium extensions forum.Posted by James Wagner, Chrome Extensions Product Manager",

            "description": "Copied and pasted from this source (their Facebook page): https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=520553735074849&id=309802072816684 PS4 version was succeeded and we got the profit as we expected. But it was not huge success like as jack-pot. However, we are not satisfied with this result, we will continue to improve the game for further success. *About Steam  Steam版について  While the sales of the PS4 version weren't the best, it was thanks to everyone's support that we were able to release two additional characters at no extra charge. We truly thank you.  PS４版の成績はベストな物ではありませんが、 それでも皆様のおかげで２キャラクターを無償でリリースすることができました。 本当にありがとうございます。  As we promised in our original plan, we would like to begin working on a Steam version. However, since we do not have a Season Pass or DLC, we do not have enough Development Funds. Therefore, we are facing a dilemma where we cannot work on the Steam version and the newest Update at the same time. In addition, we are also developing the Arcade version right now.  我々は検討を約束をしていたSteam版への着手を行いたいと考えました。 しかしながら有償販売やシーズンパスを行っていないので十分な開発費はありません。 その為、Steam版に着手するということは最新版へのアップデートが同時に行えないというジレンマがあります。 また現在、アーケード版の開発も行っております。 。  So, after taking everything into consideration, we decided to prioritize working on the Steam version. The main reason is that the arcade board used by Taito runs the same OS as Steam.  我々は検討の結果、アーケード版とSteam版を先に開発することにしました。 これはタイトー社様のアーケードボードがSteamと同じOSであることが最大の理由でした。  We have decided to develop this as Version 1.1.1 (the current PS4 version is 1.1.0). We did not plan on adding any balance changes.  このバーションを1.1.1として検討していました（PS４版は1.1.0）。 調整内容には差がない予定でした。  However, the other day Nishitani-san said that he wished to change some of the Gougi decks, which if we decide to do, would lead to the Arcade and Steam versions being 1.1.1 while the PS4 version remains 1.1.0, which means there would be a difference between platforms.  しかし先日、西谷から、強氣デッキの調整を行いたいとの進言があり、 もし実施すると、アーケード版とSteam版の1.1.1とPS4版の1.1.0の間に、ゲーム調整の差が存在することになります。  We fully understand that this would not make the PS4 users happy. So, we decided to push ourselves are update the PS4 version to 1.1.1 as well.  それはPS4ユーザにとって嬉しいはずでないことは我々は十分に理解しています。 そこで、我々は無理をしてPS4版も1.1.1にすることにしました。  Right now, the Development Team is putting everything they have into releasing the same version over 3 different platforms. There may end up being some slight differences between the versions, but we ask for your understanding.  開発チームは全力でこの３ハードのリリースを目指します。 承認の都合でリリース日に差は出るかもしれませんが、ご理解の程をお願い致します。  Also, please understand that the reality that the development of any potential updates or new content is based on the sales of these upcoming versions.  また、新しいバージョンの開発がこれらの売上に左右されている現実もご容赦下さい。  When the release day is decided, we will make a formal announcement.  リリース日が決まり次第、アナウンスさせていただきます。  One last thing that we would like to ask for your understanding on. We will be providing a small number of Steam Beta Keys to help with promotion and testing of the network. We will take full responsibility for these actions. There may also be cases where we have people playing in official exhibitions before the game is released to the public. We humbly ask for your understanding.  またもうひとつ、ご理解いただきたい件があります。 Steam版のβキーを宣伝やテストに協力していただく方に出しています。 これは全て我々の責任で行っております。 宣伝になる、ので先行して配信プレイを公開してもらう場合もあります。 ご理解の程、宜しくお願い致しま す。  *About Crossplay  クロスプレーについて  We are terribly sorry, but this impossible with our company's assets. We do not have the funding to prepare an Entry Server, Matching Server, and Relay Server around the entire world. It's impossible to do without having a game that's a huge hit worldwide as well as plenty of DLC items to cover the funds. We apologize for our lack of ability.  本当に申し訳ありませんが、我々の財力では不可能です。 エントリーサーバ、マッチングサーバ、リレーサーバーを全世界で用意できる財源はありません。 全世界で爆発的なヒットをして、その後追加課金アイテムが潤沢に売れないと不可能です。 力不足ですみません。     submitted by    /u/MerryDingoes   [link] [comments]",

She volunteered for them 30 or so years ago so she has some fond memories in helping to continue the good work she saw happen at the time. Anyways the letter they sent us has the right address. But the last name is nothing like our last name. Not even close. If I had to compare it to numbers it would be like having the last name 1234432 vs 4344356 which is what they gave us. Since they got the middle letters right yet everything else is wrong it almost feels like it was done on purpose. I was thinking that we need the correct name if we were to report the donation for taxes, or on their side needs to have the name reported correctly for tax purposes.    submitted by    /u/diff2   [link] [comments]",

The company has finished painting a giant “X” on the surface, aimed at making it stick out as the rocket comes back, in a big step for rocket reusability.The pad is positioned around a quarter of a mile away from the Vandenberg Air Force Base on California. Teslarati notes that SpaceX has been working on the pad since around late 2014, with a slow development process in part due to the fact that the company simply didn’t need the pad before now. Construction was completed earlier this year. SpaceX was unable to use the pad between March and June as local regulations bar return-to-launch-site recoveries to protect local harbor seals. The publication notes that, while unconfirmed, it’s likely using radar reflective paint like the type used at the Florida landing zones.Read More...

            "description": "Greetings dear citizens of Reddit, everything took longer than expected, but we still want to provide you with the information we have gathered. First we give you a tl;dr version of the results. Then we want to run you quickly through the theory behind our study, then we tell you a little about the sample size we were able to gather (this is you guys). Then we give you a long run through the results including tons of tables and statistical stuff for the people that want to know more than our tl;dr version. Feel free to ask questions, we try to answer them.  TL;DR Results   These results only show correlations, not coherence’s, meaning that we can’t say that playing videogames are the major factor that lead to these results. It is also possible, that people that show these traits are more likely to play video games. Significance is not a sign of a huge effect, it just states that the result is most likely no coincidence. The effect power for all found results were small unless stated otherwise. In the tl;dr section all effects are significant  We didn’t find any effects of skill to affect the results in any kind. I personally believe that we might have been able to find results there if we had tested for reaction time in a real-life location, but that’s just a personal opinion. However we did find effects in risk taking, risk perception and the expected benefits of risk taking. All Players (Dota 2; Overwatch; Hearthstone) had some similarities: Risk Domain: Gambling All Players do perceive the risk of gambling higher than non players. But they match non-players in Risk Taking and the expected benefits of gambling. No one seems to like RNGjesus Extraversion: All Players showed a lower score in extraversion than non-players. Noteworthy: No moderation effects were achieved by temperament Dota2: Risk Domain: Financial Investment Dota 2 Players are more likely to take risks in this domain, than non-players. They perceive the risk of financial investment as lower and expect more benefits from it than non players. Everyone go Midas! Risk Domain: Health / Safety Non-Players perceive health/saftey related risks as more threatening than Dota2-Players. But they match Dota2 Players in Risk Taking and the expected benefits. Overwatch: Risk Domain: Financial Investment Overwatch Players are more likely to take risks in this domain, than non-players. They also expect more benefits from it than non players. But they match Non-Players in the perceived risk of financial investments. Hearthstone: Risk Domain: Financial Investment Hearthstone Players are more likely to take risks in this domain, than non-players. They perceive the risk of financial investment as lower and expect more benefits from it than non players. Risk Domain: Health / Safety Non-Players perceive health/saftey related risks as more threatening than Hearthstone Players. But they match Hearthstone Players in Risk Taking and the expected benefits. Risk Domain: Recreational Non-Players are expecting more benefits from recreational risks than Hearthstone Players. But they match Hearthstone Players in Risk Taking and Risk Perception. Risk Domain: Social Hearthstone Players would significantly more likely take risks in this domain than non-players. They perceive the risk as lower. ​ Theory To provide a good and light start i'd like to begin with the basics, the structure of our theory. Basically our theory consists out of two main parts. The first part is about risk, how we perceive risk and how we behave in risky situations. The second part is about gaming and video games and sums up some of the effects found in the last 20 years. Risk 1.(Short digression) Theory of learning For our research it was pretty important to know how learning works, meaning, how certain skills that are trained in specific situations (like playing a video game), are transfered into everyday situations. Grossman & Salas (2011) found some interpersonal variables that, depending on their shaping, either favor or hinder a transfer of skills from one situation to another. Those variables are cognitive abilities, self-efficacy, motivation and expected outcome of learning something. There are also situational variables like how similar are the surroundings of your \"place of learning\" and your \"place of used skills\" (Perkins & Salomon 1992). The more similar the easier the transfer of skills. Those variables are important because a lot of video games inherently promote the motivation to play them, and they do this by giving you a feeling of self-efficacy. Given the fact that video games and virtual reality will get more and more realistic the coming years there's also a good chance that the factor \"similar surroundings\" will play a geater role in future skill-transfer through video games or trainings. 2.Analytical System vs Experiental System Psychological research showed that there are basically two ways we assess risk. The first way is the analytical one where we try to calculate any risk factor given by a certain situation. This is, as you can imagine, a very slow process and in everyday situations we often don't have the time to do such a complex evaluation. For those everyday situations we mostly use the experiental way. This way of assessing a risk is based on personal experience and subjective risk values and is therefore way faster but also a lot more error-prone (Slovic, Finucane, Peters, & MacGregor, 2004). 3.Prospect Theory Another important factor for wether a person will take a certain risk or not is the expected benefit or loss of engaging in this certain risk. Kahneman and Tversky (1979) adressed this factor in their prospect theory. The base of this theory is an experiment in which people had varied probabilities of (fictively) winning or losing money. From observing how people engage or dont engage in financial risks they could form some rule of thumbs to describe this behaviour. First, if there is a safe probability to win money amongst more risky options, people tend to go for the safe pick. Second, if people have to choose from different probabilities of losing money (ranging from high risk-low loss to low risk-high loss) people tend to go for the low risk option, even if that means they would lose a lot more money if they are unlucky. 4.Risk Domains Measuring risk perception and behaviour is pretty difficult as psychologists are still in a debate about the structure of those two constructs. Until the late nineties risk behaviour was measured on a onedimensional scale ranging from \"risk averse person\" to \"risk taker person\". It were Blais & Weber (2002, 2006) who postulated that risk should be measured on a more-dimensional scale and so they conducted the five so-called life domains. They measured risk perception, risk behaviour and expected benefit of engaging in certain risky activities. Those activities were related to the postulated life domains: Health and safety risks, social risks, ethical risks, recreational risks, and financial risks (split into financial gambling and financial investment). The results showed, that people show significantly different risk behaviour between those five scales. For example a person can be really risk-taking in terms of recreational risks and do extreme sports but at the same time be very risk averse in terms of financial investments. In our research we used the test \"DOSPERT\" which Blais and Weber (2002) created to measure the risk behaviour, risk perception and expected benefit of people who either play our chosen video games or dont play video games at all. With the five different scales we could take a more fine-grained look if there are specific scales on which video games may have a stronger effect. 5.Temperament There is evidence that people who score high on certain personality traits like extraversion or neurotizism also show different risk behavior than people who score average on those traits (Lauriola & Weller, in press). To see if personality traits have a moderating effect on the risk behaviour of our population we put a personality test into our online survey. ​ Gaming 1.Transfer of skills through games A meta-analysis conducted by Uttal et al (2013) came to the conclusion, that playing shooter games enhances the spatial skills of the gamer. Even just playing over short periods of time leads to stable and constant effects regarding this observation. Spatial skills are a good predictor for later success in fields like science or engineering (Lubinski, 2010). A FMRI-Study done by Bavelier, Achtman, Mani & Föcker (2012) could find some hints that playing shooter games may enhances attentional control, a skill needed to fastly sort out important from less important information in new situations. Russoniello et al (2009) found that playing puzzle games like bejeweled leads to a better mood and to relief from anxious emotional states. Dye, Green and Bavelier (2009) also found, that playing shooter or simulation games decreases the players reaction time. Playing simulation games lead to an increase of 6% in reaction speed in an speeded choice task whereas shooter games lead to an 13% increase. We know that playing certain games leads to enhancement in related cognitive abilities and that those skills are transferable into everyday life.We also know that people often use their experience in their risk judgement process. This lead to our final scientific Questions: Does it have an impact on a gamers risk judgement to play games like Hearthstone, Overwatch or Dota 2 where they are constantly confronted with risky situations and not enough time to calculate through the probabilities? ​ Sample Size We had a sample size of 1286 valid datasets. The adjusted sample size consisted of 218 Hearthstone Players, 447 Overwatch Players, 347 Overwatch Players and 117 Non-Gamers. Our youngest participants were 18 (due to our pledge to the ethics commitee) and our oldest participant was 73. The mean was 24.74 Years with a Standard Derivation of 6.35 Years. 19.44% of the sample size were female, 79.63% were male, and 0.93% fell into the other category. The biggest contributers (by country) to our survey were the USA with 33.44% of the sample size, followed by Germany with 20.68% of the sample size. Overall People from 74 Countries contributed to our survey. Reddit did also contribute the biggest amount of people with 58.71% of the sample size, followed by Surveycircle with 6.38%. Problematic Factors regarding the sample size: The Non-Gamer Group consisted of 78.63% Females and 21.37% Males, which nearly exclusively were located in german-speaking countries. The Hearthstone Group consisted of 8.72% Females and 89.91% Males and 1,38% Others. The Overwatch Group consisted of 15.21% Females and 83% Males and 1.8% Others. The Dota 2 Group consisted of 2.88% Females and 96.83% Males and 0.29% Others. The Gamers Groups always consisted from People all over the Planet. These factors can result in bias, which we can’t adjust. But as we have found different results for the games we believe that the results at least are able to show a trend. Sadly the League of Legends subreddit didn’t want to participate in our survey, resulting in having not enough persons to take the players into account. ​ Results Comments on the Tables are found in the comments of the google table. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g2_0e9e2fIZbmdPYf76qqT8jiCmWpcWfqxxhqOb8DT0/edit?usp=sharing Discussion As a disclaimer: These results only show correlations, not coherence’s, meaning that we can’t say that playing videogames are the major factor that lead to these results. It is also possible, that people that show these traits are more likely to play video games. We didn’t find any effects of skill or temperament to affect the results in any kind. I personally believe that we might have been able to find results there if we had tested for reaction time in a real-life location, but that’s just a personal opinion. We also don’t know if the found effects are only temporary. It’s not necessarily a bad thing to find small or no effects, because it only proves that we tend to overestimate the influence that video games have on us. None of the results reached an effect power of d = 0.5 or more, at which an effect is considered a mediocre effect. Also we can’t judge if the outcome can be considered a positive or negative effect for the human beeings, because we didn’t measure that. ​ Sources Bavelier, D., Achtman, R.
